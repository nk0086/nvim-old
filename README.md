# nvim
These are configuration files for neovim.  

## dein.toml & dein_lazy.toml
These are the files that manage the plugins.  
When you use coc.nvim, you need to install additional plugins from [here](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions#implemented-coc-extensions). I use coc-neosnippet and coc-json, coc-rls.
